# Calculator app

![Mockup of desktop hard mode view](design/desktop-preview.png)

## Overview

The calculator app allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo division, and exponentiation. In addition, the app includes a history feature that stores all previous calculations for easy reference. Users can also customize the appearance of the app by choosing from three different themes.

The selected theme and calculation history are saved as localStorage values, which allows users to retain their preferred theme and previous calculations even when the app is closed and reopened. This ensures that users can easily switch between themes and review their past calculations without having to start over every time they use the app.
